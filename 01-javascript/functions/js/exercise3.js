/*
The Lifetime Supply Calculator

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

Write a function named calculateSupply that:

takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.
*/


var calculateSupply = function (currentAge, amountPerDay) {
  var maximumAge = 94;

  var yearsRemaining = maximumAge - currentAge;
  var amountPerYear = amountPerDay * 365.25;

  var totalRequired = yearsRemaining * amountPerYear;

  console.log("You will need " + totalRequired + " to last you until the ripe old age of " + maximumAge);
};

calculateSupply(27, 4);
calculateSupply(93, 1);
calculateSupply(17, 0);
